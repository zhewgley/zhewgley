# Hello World
I am Zane or @zhewgley. I am not particularly good at introductions so there you have it!

## Thought
I generally tell people I am interested in spending time with my family and learning. Knowledge is key in this world and teaching our children of the future
the skills and values is much needed.

## Education
I am currently studying Computer Science: Software Engineering. Teaching myself along side formal education by continuously doing small projects to enhance skills.

## Collaboration
I honestly believe I am in way over my head at this point, but in the future I would love to collaborate on open-source projects of all kinds.
